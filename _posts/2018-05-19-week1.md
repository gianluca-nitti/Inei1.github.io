#### First Week: Frontend Changes, Packaging, and SIGAR
Most of this week was dedicated to final exams and learning the codebase for the FacadeServer and FacadeServerFrontend. Monday and Tuesday of this week were occupied by final exams. I Got to learn more about the design of the facadeserver as well, so future weeks will definitely be more productive.
Packaging was a goal for this week, but there have been issues with making binary distributions of the server facade with jenkins, so this goal is put on hold for a short amount of time. I have played around a bit with the launcher, and I think I have a good idea of what to do to make the FacadeServer easy to download.
Now that the first week is over and I have more knowledge of what I am working with, I should be able work much quicker.
Code this week consists of two main things worked on.
[Code for the logout button](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/2){:.gh-pr}\\
\\
![LogoutButton]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/LogoutButton.PNG)\\
\\
I added a logout button to the frontend. This button currently just refreshes the page, which both logs the user out and also disconnects them from the server. Ideally, it should only log the user out.
Also, the native build for Android (and iOS too) appears to not work correctly. There is no logout button for it at the moment.\\
\\
![CpuAndMemoryUsagePercentage]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CPUMemoryPercentage.PNG)\\
\\
It appears that the memory percentage reported is slightly lower with SIGAR than with task manager, but it is a minimal difference. Maybe the difference is caused by the server being on a local machine. Code for this isn't yet in any PR, but there should be one on Sunday or Monday.
SIGAR makes it really easy to get a lot of data about the system. This is all you need for the CPU usage:
```Java
	Sigar sigar = new Sigar();
        try {
            CpuPerc cpuperc = sigar.getCpuPerc();
        } catch (SigarException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        // percentage of CPU usage
        double cpuUsage = cpuperc.getCombined() * 100;
```
The original proposal only mentioned CPU and RAM usage, but it looks like it is easy to do more. Hopefully I won't go crazy with adding too much!
One concern with using SIGAR is that is requires a binary dll (or equivalent for other operating systems) to be in the path environment variable. SIGAR uses the Apache license 2, which allows redistributing binaries (I think?). It shouldn't be too hard to add the dlls to the path with a bit of experimenting, but the hard part will be to find where in the code to do so.
